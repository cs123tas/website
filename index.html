	<h3>Welcome to CS123. If you have not yet gotten mail about the first class, please reach out to cs123tas@cs.brown.edu </h3>
	<p>
			
		This course offers an in-depth exploration of fundamental concepts in 2D and 3D computer graphics. It introduces 2D raster graphics techniques, including scan conversion, simple image processing, interaction techniques and user interface design. The bulk of the course is devoted to 3D modeling, geometric transformations, and 3D viewing and rendering. A sequence of assignments culminates in a simple geometric modeler and ray tracer. C++ and the graphics library OGL are used throughout the course, as is shader programming on the GPU, taught from the first lab onwards. The final project is typically a small group project spec'd and implemented by the group using shaders to create special effects.

	<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
	<p>
		The official prerequisites for CS1230 are CS15/16, CS17/18, or CS19. CS33, because it uses C, is very helpful but not strictly required. CS32, for its software design, is additionally helpful but not required. Some familiarity with C++ will be helpful, but help sessions and extra support will be offered to students who don't have any prior C++ experience. Some knowledge of basic linear algebra (i.e., vector and matrix multiplication, dot and cross products) may also be helpful, but none is required or assumed.
